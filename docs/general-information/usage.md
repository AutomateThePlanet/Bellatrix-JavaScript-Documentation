Contains the full source code of BELLATRIX Test Automation Framework and Templates for faster usage

BELLATRIX is not a single thing it contains multiple framework libraries, extensions and tools. The tool is built to be cross-platform, however some of the features can be used under Windows since they are written for Visual Studio.

Simple Installation
------------------
1. Download the BELLATRIX projects as a zip file from the Code green button in the right corner.
2. Unzip it. Open BELLATRIX-JavaScript in Visual Studio Code.
3. Open terminal and type `npm ci` in the root of the project.

4. In order to run the sample tests, navigate to the example folder with terminal and type `npm run test`.
5. You can try to write a simple test yourself.
6. For an in-depth revision of all framework features you can check the [**official documentation**](http://docs.javascript.bellatrix.solutions/web-automation/)

Release Strategy
--------
**Versioning**

Our project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) for clear and predictable version management. Each release is tagged with a unique version number that reflects the nature of the changes made.

**Tags and Releases**
-   **Tags:** We create Git tags for each release to mark specific points in the project's history, making it easier for users to switch between versions.
-   **Release Notes:** Detailed notes accompany [each release](https://bellatrix.solutions/roadmap/release-3-9-0-0-lyra/), highlighting new features, bug fixes, and any breaking changes.


**Accessing Releases**

Users can access the specific releases directly from our GitHub repository's Releases page or BELLATRIX website's roadmap section. Each release includes a tag, a summary of changes, and assets (if applicable).

Integrating BELLATRIX as a Submodule in Your Project
--------
To leverage a specific version of BELLATRIX in your project, you can add it as a Git submodule. This allows you to keep your copy of BELLATRIX up to date or locked to a specific version, depending on your project's needs.
**Navigate to Your Project Directory:** Open a terminal and change to the directory where your project is located.
**Add BELLATRIX as a Submodule:** Use the following Git command to add BELLATRIX as a submodule to your project:
```
git submodule add https://github.com/BELLATRIX-Library/BELLATRIX.git path/to/submodule
``` 
Replace `path/to/submodule` with the relative path within your project where you'd like the BELLATRIX submodule to reside.
**Initialize and Clone the Submodule:** If you're adding the submodule for the first time, initialize your local configuration file and clone the BELLATRIX repository as follows:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Checking Out a Specific Tag (Release Version)
--------
After adding BELLATRIX as a submodule, you might want to use a specific release version rather than the latest commit on the main branch.
**Navigate to the Submodule Directory:** Change into the BELLATRIX submodule directory within your project:
```
cd path/to/submodule
```
**Fetch All Tags from the BELLATRIX Repository:** To ensure you have a list of all available tags, fetch them:
```
git fetch --tags
```
**Checkout the Desired Tag:** Check out the specific tag (release version) you want to use by replacing `<tagname>` with the desired version:
```   
git checkout tags/<tagname>` 
```
For example, if you want to check out version `v3.9.0.0`, you would use:
```
git checkout tags/v3.9.0.0
```
**Commit the Submodule Change:** Navigate back to your project's root directory, and commit the change to the submodule reference:
```
cd ../..
git add path/to/submodule
git commit -m "Update BELLATRIX submodule to v3.9.0.0"
```
This process ensures that your project uses a specific, fixed version of BELLATRIX, providing stability and consistency across environments or deployments.
